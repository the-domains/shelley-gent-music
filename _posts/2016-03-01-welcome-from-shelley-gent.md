Hello and thanks for visiting my new website!  
Contained within these virtual pages is a whole host of information about me and my music - from my string arranging work, to cello performances, children's tuition and music story books. I hope you find the content interesting, informative and even a little fun.   
Please do get in touch if you'd have any questions or suggestions, or would like to make a booking. I'd love to hear from you!
